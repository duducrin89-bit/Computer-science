Hi! I want to help beginner programmers solve problems to develop their  skills or copy paste my projects into an editor
and see how python works

I recommend using Pycharm from Jetbrains.
Pycharm is an IDE for writing python code

VS Code is good too 
but I use it for other programming languages!üßë‚Äçüíª

I also recommend if you want color codes for html, css, python(tkinter/pyqt6) etc,
you should go to https://htmlcolorcodes.com
