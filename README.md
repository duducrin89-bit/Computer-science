Hi! I want to help beginner programmers solve problems to develop their  skills or copy paste my projects into an editor
and see how python works

I recommend using Pycharm from Jetbrains.
Pycharm is an IDE for writing python code

VS Code is good too 
but I use it for other programming languages!🧑‍💻


And that's all! 
I will update the projects and the README.md sometimes.😊
